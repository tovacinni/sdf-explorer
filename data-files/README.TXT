SDF files must be in .glsl files in immediate subdirectories of the sdf/ directory
(no recursive structure, nothing directly in the sdf/ directory).

To move the camera, right click (or ctrl-click) and hold on the 3D
part of the window and then use first person shooter controls: mouse
to rotate the camera, and WASD (or arrow keys): W for forward, S for
back, and A and D for strafing left and right. Z to move up and C to
move down. Hold Alt to move faster and Shift to move slower.  A
dual-stick game controller will also work.

F5 to reload shaders (including the one that you're editing as an SDF...)
